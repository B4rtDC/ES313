# Introduction
## Who are we?

## Why Modeling and Simulation
Reality is often too complex, costly, time-consuming, dangerous, or simply unavailable for direct experimentation or complete analytical calculation.

!!! info "Modeling"
	The process of creating a simplified or abstract representation (a model) of a real-world system, phenomenon, or process. The goal is to capture the essential features, variables, relationships, and dynamics relevant to a specific question or objective, while deliberately omitting non-essential details to make the system easier to understand, analyze, or manipulate. Models can be conceptual, physical, mathematical, or computational.

``\rightarrow `` this provides the blueprint of a system.

!!! info "Simulation"
	The process of implementing and running a model of a real-world system or process over time. It involves executing the model's rules, equations, or logic, often computationally, to observe its dynamic behavior, study its evolution under different conditions, predict future outcomes, or generate data for analysis. 

``\rightarrow `` this allows us to use the blueprint in a practical and controlled way, overcoming the limitations of direct real-world interaction or purely analytical methods.

A typical workflow is shown in the illustration below:

		* Information gathering: data, expert knowledge, and existing theories about the system's components, behaviors, interactions, and environment.
		* Indentify key elements: determine the crucial entities, variables, parameters, relationships, and processes that influence the system's behavior relevant to the objectives.

		This study can lead to a "conceptual model": a high-level, often qualitative, representation of the system (schematic)

		This involves several steps and design choices:

		* modeling technique
		* translation of conceptual model into a formal, unambiguous representation
		* implementation of the formal representation into code

		!!! tip "Verification "
			*Did we build the model right?*

		    This can included testing with simple/known inputs where the output can be manually calculated or analytically derived. 

			``\Rightarrow`` this ensure the computer code accurately implements the formal model description.

		!!! tip "Validation "
			*Did we build the right model?*

		    This can included:
			* comparing model output against real-world data, against analytical models or results from other validated simulations
			* sensitivity analysis (does the model respond plausibly to parameter changes?), 
			* involving subject matter experts (SMEs) to review model behavior and outputs (aka "face validation").

			``\Rightarrow`` this assess whether the model's behavior and outputs are a reasonable representation of the real-world system for the intended purpose.

!!! warning "Heads up!"
	For your project, you won't use or need everything covered in this course — that is a feature, and not a bug.  

	However, the combined content covered by all the projects typically goes beyond what the course includes, showing that students begin exploring relevant concepts on their own to help solve specific problems.
