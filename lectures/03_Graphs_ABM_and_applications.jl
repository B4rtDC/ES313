# Agent-based modeling
## Principle
!!! info "Agent-based modeling (ABM)"
	A computational approach where you simulate a system by modeling its individual components (called "agents") and letting their interactions drive the overall behavior. 

	Each agent is a distinct entity with its own rules, traits, and decision-making logic, acting based on its local environment or neighbors.

Examples:
* A virtual ant colony, where each ant has simple instructions such as following pheromone trails when foraging. Although no explicit information is given related to pathfinding, organically, "ant highways" will arise.
* Traffic flows can also be studied in this framework: by imposing simple rules on accelaration, decelaration, and overtaking, realistic traffic jams will start to appear in the simulation.

!!! tip "Swarming model - Boids"
    The Boids model simulates flocking or swarming behavior seen in animals like birds or fish. It uses simple rules to mimic complex group dynamics. Each "boid" (agent) has a specific field of view, and follows three core rules:
	1. Cohesion: move toward the average position of nearby boids to stay with the group (avoids straying)
	2. Alignment: steer to match the average heading of nearby boids for coordinated movement
	3. Separation: avoid crowding by steering away from boids that are too close (avoids collisions)

    

	Illustration of the model's principles ([Wikipedia]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids")):

	``\\Rightarrow`` These simple individual rules create realistic, complex group patterns without centralized control.

Many real-world systems can be represented as (potentially different) entities that are connected in some way to one another. We often call this a network. Examples include social networks, transportation networks, computer networks, biological networks.

!!! info "Network"
	While often used interchangeably with "graph", it typically refers to a real-world system of interacting entities
    

!!! info "Graph"
	Abstract mathematical structure consisting of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or links) connecting pairs of vertices. Representation of a real-world network (potentially simplified).
    
	Notation: ``G = (V, E)`` where ``V`` is the set of vertices and ``E`` is the set of edges.

Graphs basics:
* A graph can also be represented by its adjacency matrix ``A``, where a non-zero value ``a_{ij}`` represents that a connection from node ``i`` to ``j`` is present (note how this implies that a graph can be directional). 
* Edges can also have weights (typically positive weights, altough negative weighted graphs are definined, but handling these is not straightforward)

!!! note "Path"
	A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each consecutive pair is connected by an edge. Formally, given a graph `` G = (V, E) ``, a path from vertex `` v_0`` to vertex `` v_k`` is a sequence of vertices ``v_0, v_1, \dots, v_k `` such that ``\forall i = 0, 1, \dots, k-1: (v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E``. 

	* A path can be directed and has a length, defined as the number of edges.
	* A cycle is a path where the start and end vertices are the same .
	* A simple path has no repeated vertices (except possibly the start and end in a cycle).
	


!!! note "Component"
	A component in a graph is a maximal connected subgraph, meaning a subset of vertices and edges where every pair of vertices is connected by at least one path, and no additional vertices or edges can be added while maintaining this connectivity. Formally, in an undirected graph `` G = (V, E) ``, a component is a subset `` C \subseteq V `` such that: (1) there exists a path between any pair of vertices in `` C `` and (2) `` C `` is maximal, i.e., no vertex outside `` C `` is connected to any vertex in `` C `` by an edge.

	- In a connected graph, there is exactly one component (the entire graph), whereas in a disconnected graph, there are multiple components, each isolated from the others.
	- In directed graphs, components are often defined as strongly connected components (where there is a directed path from any vertex to any other in the component) or weakly connected components (connected when ignoring edge directions).

!!! note "Betweennes Centrality"
	Betweenness centrality measures the importance of a vertex (or edge) in a graph based on how often it lies on the shortest paths between pairs of other vertices. It quantifies the extent to which a vertex acts as a "bridge" in the network.

	Formally, for a vertex `` v `` in a graph `` G = (V, E) `` the betweenness centrality `` C_B(v) `` is defined as:

	```math
	C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq t \neq v \in V} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}},
	```
	where `` \sigma_{st} `` represents the total number of shortest paths from vertex `` s `` to vertex `` t ``, and ``\sigma_{st}(v) `` represents the  number of those shortest paths that pass through vertex ``v.`` The sum is taken over all pairs of vertices `` s, t \in V `` (excluding `` v ``).

	- High betweenness centrality indicates a vertex is critical for connecting different parts of the graph. When evaluating node importance using this metric, you implicitely assume that the shortest path will be used to travel between nodes, which is not necessarily true in all applications.
	- It applies to both undirected and directed graphs, and can be computed for edges as well.
	- For disconnected, directed graphs: betweenness only reflects intra-component paths, ignoring the broader network. This can lead to a situation where high betweenness in one component might dwarf scores in another. Misinterpreting betweenness without considering connectivity could lead to overlooking key nodes or bottlenecks in specific subnetworks.

## Graph models
There are many approaches to building a network, and some of these models are detailed below
!!! tip "Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert model"
	Underlying principle: grow the network through preferential attachment, i.e. a new node always has $m$ neighbors. The neigbors are chosen at random, but proportional to the node's degree
	```math
	p_i = \frac{d_i}{\sum_j d_j}
	```

	It can be shown that the degree distribution of such a network follows a power law with coeffient ``\alpha = 3``

	This network model has been used to explain real world processes and model the internet.

While we will not go into detail on the theoretical aspect of the power law, we can try to confirm it through an experiment.

Our starting hypothesis is that the degree distribution of out Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert graph follows a power law, i.e. ``p(x=k) = C x^{-\alpha}``


In the example below, we proceed as follows:
1. we generate a random Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert graph
2. we compute the ccdf of the degree distribution
3. we fit a regression line on the tail of the ccdf (in log transform, which also follows a power law with exponent ``\alpha - 1`` (see [Newman's work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0412004) for the derivation)

# ABM on networks - epidemic spreading

## Epidemic spreading (SIR)
Epidemic spreading models how diseases propagate through a population or network. For this application we will use the SIR model, which is a foundational model for this kind of applications. 

!!! note "SIR model"
	In an SIR model, the population members (agents), can be in one of three states:
	- S (Susceptible): individuals who can contract the disease.
	- I (Infected): individuals who have the disease and can spread it.
	- R (Recovered: individuals who have recovered and are immune (or removed, e.g., deceased).
	
	The model allows for the following transitions: 
	- Infection process: ``S \mapsto I``.
	- Recovery process: ``I \mapsto R``.

## SIR model on networks
A network can be used to model the structure of real-world interactions between people (social network).
So infections will occur along edges between nodes, reflecting contact patterns.
In the SIR model on a network:
- Each node represents an individual in one of the states (S, I, or R).
- Edges represent potential transmission pathways.
- Parameters:
  - Infection rate ``\beta``: probability an infected node infects a susceptible neighbor per time step.
  - Recovery rate ``\gamma``: probability an infected node recovers per time step.

The dynamics evolve in discrete time steps:
1. Infected nodes attempt to infect susceptible neighbors with probability `` \beta ``
2. Infected nodes recover with probability `` \gamma ``
3. The process continues until no infected nodes remain or a set number of steps is reached.

## Implementation principles
- Synchronous updates: all state changes (infections and recoveries) are computed based on the current state and applied simultaneously, avoiding order-dependent artifacts.
- The graph structure determines who can infect whom, capturing realistic contact patterns .
- Using random numbers (`rand() < Œ≤` and `rand() < Œ≥`) introduces stochastic behavior, reflecting real-world variability.
