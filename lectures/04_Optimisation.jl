In this chapter we wil have a look at some optimisation methods, and their applications. Depending on your future needs, you might even need more advanced or niche solvers. In that case, the following references can be of help:
* [Algorithms for Optimization, by Mykel J. Kochenderfer and Tim A. Wheeler](https://algorithmsbook.com/optimization/)
* [Optimization.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Optimization/stable/) package, which not only provides a unified interface to many optimisation package, but can also serve as a starting point to find the tool suited for the job.
* [NLOpt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), an open-source library for nonlinear optimization.


## Introduction
!!! info "Optimisation"
	The process of making a system, design, or decision as effective or functional as possible. It involves finding the best solution from a set of feasible solutions. It typically be described in a more formal way by the following components:
	- Objective function: the function that needs to be maximised or minimised.
	- Decision variables: the variables that influence the outcome of the objective function.
	- Constraints: restrictions or limitations on the decision variables (if applicable).

	Formally:
	```math
	\min_{\vec{x} \in \Omega } f(\vec{x}) \text{ subject to } \cases{\vec{h}(\vec{x}) = \vec{0}\\ \vec{g}(\vec{x}) \leq \vec{0}}
	```
	where 
	```math
	\begin{array}
	\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n,\\ 
	\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n,\\  
	f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R},\\ 
	\vec{h} :  \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^m \; (m\leq n),\\
	\vec{g} :  \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^p.
	\end{array}
	```


!!! danger "Heads up!"
	1. You have already encountered this type of problems in your (vector) analysis courses.

	2. For real world problems, properly defining the objective function, the variables, their domains, and all of the constraints not only is critical for a decent solution, but it is typically experienced as being one of the most difficult steps.


!!! info "Classification"

	| Dimension | Possibilities |
	| :-- | :-- |
	| Objective type | linear, nonlinear, black-box |
	| Constraints | none, equalities``^*``, inequalities``^*``, integer values, boolean values |
	| Determinism | deterministic ``\leftrightarrow`` stochastic |
	| Convexity| convex, non-convex |
	
	
	``^*``these constraints can also be linear or not, which in turn has an impact on suited algorithms.


Optimisation is a critical tool used across various fields to improve efficiency and outcomes. Being able to formulate a real-world application as an optimisation problem and knowing what is the most appropriate technique to solve it, is a very valuable and an indispensable skill for engineers.

## Unconstrained optimisation
!!! info "Setting"
	Suppose we are dealing with an objective function that is (non)linear, without any imposed constraints. The solution of the unconstrained optimization problem
	
	```math
	\min f\left(\vec x\right)
	```
	
	can often be found by finding a critical point $\vec{x}^*$, such that the first order necessary condition holds:
	
	```math
	\nabla f\left(\vec x^\star\right) = \vec 0\,.
	```
	
	This point may be a local minimum, maximum or a saddle point. If ``f`` is twice differentiable, and the Hessian, $\mathcal{H}f(\vec{x}^*$), is positive definite, then $\vec{x}^*$ is a local minimum (second order sufficient condition). Additionally, if ``f`` is convex, any local minimum is also a global minimum (cf. analysis courses). For strictly convex functions, the global minimum is unique.




!!! danger "Heads up!"
	1. In order to be able to apply this, we need to have a function that in continuous, which may not always be the case!

	    To apply gradient-based methods, the function ``f`` must be differentiable at ``\vec{x}^*``. For the Hessian test, it must be twice differentiable. If ``f`` is not differentiable, alternative methods are needed. Additionally, linear functions may not have critical points unless, and thus may not have a finite minimum in unconstrained optimization.

	2. These methods require an initial point. When multiple local minima exist, the initial point will have an impact on the result.

We can distinguish different optimization methods based on the number of derivatives used:
* Zeroth-order methods: use only function evaluations;
* First-order methods: use the gradient;
* Second-order methods: use the Hessian.

### Zeroth-order methods
!!! info "Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm"
	Nelder-Mead is a derivative-free optimizer of an function in ``n`` variables that keeps a simplex of ``n + 1`` points moving over the objective surface. At each step it ranks the points by their function value, tosses out the worst one, and tries four rules in order:
	- reflection (flip it through the centroid)
	- expansion (push farther if it improved)
	- contraction (pull back if it got worse)
	- shrink (tighten the whole tent if nothing helped). 
	The simplex keeps reshaping itself until its size or the spread in function values falls below a tolerance, giving a local minimum. This methods works fairly well for a limited number of variables (<=10)

A simplex is a geometric object determined by an assembly of $n+1$ points, $\vec{p}_{0},\vec{p}_{1},\dots,\vec{p}_{n}$, in the n-dimensional space such that

```math
\det\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{p}_{0} & \vec{p}_{1} & \cdots & \vec{p}_{n}\\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}\neq0\,.
```

This condition ensures that two points in $\mathbb R$ do not coincide, three points in $\mathbb R^{2}$ are not collinear, four points in $\mathbb R^{3}$ are not coplanar, and so on. Thus, a simplex in $\mathbb R$ is a line segment, in $\mathbb R^{2}$ it is a triangle, while a simplex in $\mathbb R^{3}$ is a tetrahedron; in each case it encloses a finite $n$-dimensional volume.
"""
simplex_basics = PlutoUI.details("Simplex definition", simplex_basics_content,open=false)

initial_simplex_content = md"""
Suppose that we wish to minimize $f\left(\vec{x}\right),\,\vec{x}\in\mathbb R^{n}$.
To start the algorithm, we initialize a simplex of $n+1$ points.
A possible way to set up a simplex is to start with an initial point
$\vec{x}^{\left(0\right)}=\vec{p}_{0}$ and generate the remaining
points of the initial simplex as follows:

```math
\vec{p}_{i}=\vec{p}_{0}+\lambda_{i}\vec{e}_{i},\quad i=1,2,\dots,n\:,
```

where the $\vec{e}_{i}$ are unit vectors constituting the natural
basis of $\mathbb R^{n}$. The positive constant coefficients $\lambda_{i}$
are selected in such a way that their magnitudes reflect the length
scale of the optimization problem.

Our objective is to modify the initial simplex stage by stage so that
the resulting simplices converge toward the minimizer. At each iteration
we evaluate the function $f$ at each point of the simplex. In the
function minimization process, the point with the largest function
value is replaced with another point. The process for modifying the
simplex continues until it converges toward the function minimizer.
"""
initial_simplex = PlutoUI.details("Initial simplex construction", initial_simplex_content,open=false)

simplex_updates_content = md"""
To understand the rules for modifying the simplex stage by stage, we use a two-dimensional example. 
We begin by selecting the initial set of $n+1$ points
that are to form the initial simplex. We next evaluate $f$ at each
point and order the $n+1$ vertices to satisfy

```math
f\left(\vec{p}_{0}\right)\leq f\left(\vec{p}_{1}\right)\leq\cdots\leq f\left(\vec{p}_{n}\right)\,.
```

For the two-dimensional case we let $\vec{p}_{l}$, $\vec{p}_{n}$
and $\vec{p}_{s}$ denote the points of the simplex for which $f$
is largest, next largest and smallest. We next compute $\vec{p}_{g}$,
the _centroid_ (center of gravity) of the best $n$ points:

```math
\vec{p}_{g}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vec{p}_{i}\,.
```

We then reflect the worst vertex, $\vec{p}_{n}$, in $\vec{p}_{g}$
using a _reflection coefficient_ $\rho>0$ to obtain the reflection
point

```math
\vec{p}_{r}=\vec{p}_{g}+\rho\left(\vec{p}_{g}-\vec{p}_{n}\right)\,.
```

A typical value is $\rho=1$. 

We proceed to evaluate $f$ at $\vec{p}_{r}$. If $f\left(\vec{p}_{0}\right)\leq f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)<f\left(\vec{p}_{n-1}\right)$,
then the point $\vec{p}_{r}$ replaces $\vec{p}_{l}$ to form a new
simplex and we terminate the iteration. We proceed to repeat the process.

If , however, $f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)<f\left(\vec{p}_{0}\right)$,
so that the point $\vec{p}_{r}$ yields the smallest function value
among the points of the simplex, we argue that this direction is a
good one. In this case we increase the distance traveled using an
_expansion coefficient_ $\chi>1$, e.g. $\chi=2$, to obtain

```math
\vec{p}_{e}=\vec{p}_{g}+\chi\left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{g}\right)\,.
```

This operation yields a new point on the line $\vec{p}_{n}\vec{p}_{g}\vec{p}_{r}$
extend beyond $\vec{p}_{r}$. If $f\left(\vec{p}_{e}\right)<f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)$,
the expansion is declared a success and $\vec{p}_{e}$ replaces $\vec{p}_{n}$
in the next simplex. If, on the other hand, $f\left(\vec{p}_{e}\right)\geq f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)$,
the expansion is a failure and $\vec{p}_{r}$ replaces $\vec{p}_{n}$.

Finally, if $f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)\geq f\left(\vec{p}_{n-1}\right)$,
the reflected point $\vec{p}_{r}$ would constitute the point with
the largest function value in the new simplex. Then in the next step
it would be reflected in $\vec{p}_{g}$, probably an unfruitful operation.
Instead, this case is dealt with by a _contraction_ operation
in one of two ways. First, if $f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)<f\left(\vec{p}_{n}\right)$,
then we contract $\left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{g}\right)$ with a _contraction
coefficient_ $0<\gamma<1$, e.g. $\gamma=\frac{1}{2}$, to obtain
```math
\vec{p}_{c}=\vec{p}_{g}+\gamma\left(\vec{p}_{r}-\vec{p}_{g}\right)\,.
```

We refer to this operation as the _outside contraction_. If,
on the other hand, $f\left(\vec{p}_{r}\right)\geq f\left(\vec{p}_{n}\right)$,
then $\vec{p}_{l}$ replaces $\vec{p}_{r}$ in the contraction operation
and we get

```math
\vec{p}_{c}=\vec{p}_{g}+\gamma\left(\vec{p}_{l}-\vec{p}_{g}\right)\,.
```

This operation is referred to as the _inside contraction_.

If , in either case, $f\left(\vec{p}_{c}\right)\leq f\left(\vec{p}_{n}\right)$,
the contraction is considered a success, and we replace $\vec{p}_{n}$
with $\vec{p}_{c}$ in the new simplex. If, however, $f\left(\vec{p}_{c}\right)>f\left(\vec{p}_{n}\right)$,
the contraction is a failure, and in this case a new simplex can be
formed by retaining $\vec{p}_{0}$ only and halving the distance from
$\vec{p}_{0}$ to every point in the simplex. We can refer to this
event as a _shrinkage operation_. In general, the shrink step
produces the $n$ new vertices of the new simplex according to the
formula

```math
\vec{v}_{i}=\vec{p}_{0}+\sigma\left(\vec{p}_{i}-\vec{p}_{0}\right)\,,\quad i=1,2,\dots,n\,,
```


where $\sigma=\frac{1}{2}$. Hence, the vertices of the new simplex
are $\vec{p}_{0},\vec{v}_{1},\dots,\vec{v}_{n}$.

When implementing the simplex algorithm, we need a tie-breaking rule
to order points in the case of equal function values. Often, the highest
possible index consistent with the relation

```math
f\left(\vec{p}_{0}\right)\leq f\left(\vec{p}_{1}\right)\leq\cdots\leq f\left(\vec{p}_{n}\right)
```

is assigned to the new vertex.

The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder–Mead_method)	also provides a nice overview.

### First-order methods

!!! info "Gradient-descent algorithm"
	Gradient descent is the simplest first-order optimizer for a smooth function in ``n`` variables.  
	At each iteration it  
	- computes the gradient ``gₖ = ∇f(xₖ)``  
	- steps downhill by ``xₖ₊₁ = xₖ − αₖ gₖ``, where the step size ``αₖ`` is chosen by a fixed “learning rate” or a line-search rule  
	The process repeats until the gradient norm (or successive position change) falls below a tolerance.  
	It needs only gradients and 𝒪(n) memory, but convergence can be slow or unstable if ``αₖ`` is poorly tuned and the objective landscape is badly scaled.

!!! info "Conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm"
	Conjugate gradient is a memory-lean, first-order optimizer that turns plain steepest-descent into Hessian-aware progress without ever storing the Hessian. It was inspired by methods to minimise quadratic functions, but can be applied to non-quadratic functions as well.
	Starting with ``p₀ = −g₀`` (the negative gradient), at each iteration it

	- does a line-search  ``xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + αₖ pₖ``  
	- computes the new gradient ``gₖ₊₁ = ∇f(xₖ₊₁)``  
	- does direction mixing ``βₖ = (gₖ₊₁ᵀ(gₖ₊₁−gₖ)) / (gₖᵀ gₖ)`` (Polak–Ribière update)  
	- determines the new direction: ``pₖ₊₁ = −gₖ₊₁ + βₖ pₖ``  

	The formula makes successive ``p``-vectors conjugate (orthogonal in the Hessian metric), so for a true quadratic CG reaches the minimizer in ``\le n`` steps for quadratic functions.


!!! warning "Info on line seach"
	Linesearch routines attempt to locate quickly an approximate minimizer of the univariate function

	```math
	\alpha \rightarrow f\left(\vec x + \alpha \vec g\right)\,,
	```

	where $\vec g$ is the descent direction computed by the algorithm. They vary in how accurate this minimization is. Two good linesearches are BackTracking and HagerZhang, the former being less stringent than the latter. For well-conditioned objective functions and methods where the step is usually well-scaled (such as L-BFGS or Newton), a rough linesearch such as BackTracking is usually the most performant. For badly behaved problems or when extreme accuracy is needed (gradients below the square root of the machine epsilon, about ``10^{−8}`` with Float64), the HagerZhang method proves more robust. An exception is the conjugate gradient method which requires an accurate linesearch to be efficient, and should be used with the HagerZhang linesearch.

!!! warning "Info on gradient computation"
	In both first and second order methods, we need the gradient. This can be obtained in different ways:
	- analytically (cf. symbolic computation)
	- using finite differences (cf. numerical analysis course)
	- using [automatic differentiation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05767)

	All of the above can be used in `Optim.jl`.

md"""
### Second-order methods
!!! info "Newton’s method"
	Newton’s method is a second-order optimizer that uses the full curvature (Hessian) of a smooth function in ``n`` variables to jump straight toward a stationary point. At each iteration it

	- computes the gradient ``gₖ = ∇f(xₖ)`` and the Hessian ``Hₖ = ∇²f(xₖ)``  
	- solves the Newton system ``Hₖ pₖ = −gₖ`` for the search direction ``pₖ``
	- updates the parameters ``xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + αₖ pₖ``, with ``αₖ = 1`` for pure Newton or reduced by a line search/trust-region when the Hessian is indefinite or far from the minimum  

	The method obtains quadratic convergence once near the solution, so it is far faster than first-order methods. But the computation of the Hessian can be costly (or infeasible for large problems).

!!! info "BFGS"
	BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) is a gradient-based quasi-Newton optimizer that iteratively builds up an estimate of the inverse Hessian (curvature) while it searches for a minimum of a smooth function in ``n`` variables.  
	At each iteration it

	- computes the gradient ``gₖ`` and proposes a search direction ``pₖ = −Hₖ gₖ`` using its current inverse-Hessian guess ``Hₖ``;
	- line-searches along ``pₖ`` until an Armijo/Wolfe condition is met;
	- updates curvature with the rank-two BFGS formula using  
	  ``sₖ = xₖ₊₁ − xₖ`` and ``yₖ = gₖ₊₁ − gₖ``  
	  so the next ``Hₖ₊₁`` stays positive-definite.

	This self-correcting Hessian gives nearly Newton-level steps without ever forming the true Hessian, so convergence is super-linear on smooth problems. The method needs gradient evaluations and ``𝒪(n²)`` memory, which is fine up to a few thousands of variables.


!!! info "L-BFGS"
	L-BFGS (Limited-Memory BFGS) keeps the same quasi-Newton idea but trims the storage.  
	Instead of holding the full ``n × n`` inverse-Hessian, it retains only the **last m pairs** of displacement/gradient vectors ``(sᵢ, yᵢ)`` (typically ``m = 5–20``):

	- a compact two-loop recursion reconstructs the action of ``Hₖ`` on the current gradient, yielding the search direction with just ``𝒪(n m)`` work  
	- the same line-search and vector update rules as full BFGS apply  

	The trade-off: memory and CPU scale linearly in ``n`` (making it suitable for millions of variables), but curvature information is less complete, so it may take more iterations to converge. 

	In practice L-BFGS is the default large-scale optimizer for engineering, scientific computing, and machine-learning tasks where gradients are available but forming or storing the full Hessian is impossible.

### Linear programming
!!! info "Definition"
	A linear program is an optimization problem of the form:
	
	```math
	\min_{\vec{x} \in \Omega } \vec{c}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x} \; \text{ subject to } 
	\cases{
	\mathbf{A}\vec x=\vec b\\
	\vec x\ge\vec 0}
	```
	where $\vec c\in\mathbb R^n$, $\vec b\in\mathbb R^m$ and $\mathbf A \in \mathbb R^{m\times n}$. 

The name "linear programming" stems from the contraints and the objective function being represented by linear relationships, so it can be considered as a special case of the more general family of optimisation problems. 
The vector inequality $\vec x\ge\vec 0$ means that each component of $\vec x$ is nonnegative. Several variations of this problem are possible; e.g. instead of minimizing, we can maximize, or the constraints may be in the form of inequalities, such as $\mathbf A\vec x\ge \vec b$ or $\mathbf A\vec x\le\vec b$. These variations can all be rewritten into the standard form by introducing slack variables.

!!! tip "Example"
	```math
	\min_{\vec{x}} x_1 +5 x_2 \; \text{ subject to }

	The simplex algorithm solves linear programs by moving from vertex to vertex along edges of the feasible polytope, improving (or at least not worsening) the objective each step.
	The method is guaranteed to arrive at an optimal solution if the problem is feasible and bounded.

	

	**Notes:** 
	1. For this to work, every inequality must be transformed into an equality by adding so-called slack variables. The method then starts from abasic feasible solution (a corner of the polytope).
	2. Memory and work per pivot are ``𝒪(m n)`` with dense tableaus, but sparse and revised variants scale to huge engineering and operations-research problems (with ``m`` being the number of constraints and ``n`` the number of variables).

	The simplex method solves linear programming (LP) problems, by optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints by moving along the boundaries (vertices) of the feasible region. For a standard LP problem:
	
	```math

	```
	
	where `c` is the cost vector, `A_eq` and `A_in` are constraint matrices, and `b_eq` and `b_in` are right-hand side vectors, the method proceeds as follows:
	
	1. Convert the problem into standard form by introducing slack variables for inequalities (e.g., `A_in x + s = b_in`, where `s ≥ 0`) and select an initial basic feasible solution (e.g., setting non-basic variables to 0 and solving for basic variables).
	
	2. At each step:
	   - Identify the entering variable (non-basic variable with negative reduced cost to improve the objective).
	   - Determine the leaving variable (basic variable to replace via the minimum ratio test, `b[i] / A[i,j]` where `A[i,j] > 0`).
	   - Update the basis by pivoting to reflect the new basic feasible solution.
	
	3. Continues until no entering variable reduces the objective (all reduced costs non-negative), indicating an optimal solution, or detects unboundedness if no leaving variable exists.

#### Interior point methods for linear programming
!!! info "Interior-point methods (linear programming)"
	Interior-point (IP) methods solve a linear program by "travelling through the interior" of the feasible polytope instead of walking its edges like the simplex method.  
	These methods are sometimes referred to as barrier methods, because they involve the use of a barrier function that ensures that the search points always remain feasible. 

	This barrier function needs to be continuous, nonnegative in the feasible region, and approach infinity as ``x`` approaches any constraint boundary.

In the 1980s it was discovered that many large linear programs could
be solved efficiently by using formulations and algorithms from nonlinear
programming. One characteristic of these methods was that they required
all iterates to satisfy the inequality constraints in the problem
strictly, so they became known as _interior-point methods_. In
the 1990s, a subclass of interior-point methods known as _primal-dual
methods_ had distinguished themselves as the most efficient practical
approaches, and proved to be strong competitors to the _simplex
method_ on large problems. Recently, it has been shown that
interior-point methods are as successful for nonlinear optimization
as for linear programming. General primal-dual interior point methods
are the focus of this section.


For simplicity, we restrict our attention to convex quadratic programs,
which we write as follows:
```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\vec{x}}\, & f\left(\vec{x}\right)\overset{\vartriangle}{=}\frac{1}{2} \vec{x}^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{x}- \vec{c}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}\\
\textrm{subject to}\, & \begin{cases}
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}=\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\,,\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}\leq\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\,,
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```
where ``Q`` is a symmetric and positive semidefinite ``n\times n`` matrix,
``\vec{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}``, ``A_{\textrm{eq}}`` is a ``m\times n`` matrix,
``\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}``, ``A_{\textrm{in}}`` is a ``p\times n``
matrix and ``\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\in\mathbb{R}^{p}``. Rewriting the KKT
conditions in this notation, we obtain
```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{\mu} & \geq\vec{0}\,,\\
Q\vec{x}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}-\vec{c} & =\vec{0}\,,\\
\left(A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\right)_{j}\mu_{j} & =0\,,\quad j=1,\dots,p\,,\\
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x} & =\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\,,\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x} & \leq\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\,.
\end{aligned}
```
By introducing the slack vector ``\vec{y}\geq\vec{0}``, we can rewrite
these conditions as
```math
\begin{aligned}
\left(\vec{\mu},\vec{y}\right) & \geq\vec{0}\,,\\
Q\vec{x}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}-\vec{c} & =\vec{0}\,,\\
y_{j}\mu_{j} & =0\,,\quad j=1,\dots,p\,,\\
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}} & =\vec{0}\,,\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}+\vec{y} & =\vec{0}\,.
\end{aligned}
```
Since we assume that ``Q`` is positive semidefinite, these KKT conditions
are not only necessary but also sufficient, so we can solve the convex
quadratic program by finding solutions of this system.

Primal-dual methods generate iterates that satisfy the bounds strictly; that is, ``\vec{y}>0``
and ``\vec{\mu}>0``. This property is the origin of the term interior-point.
By respecting these bounds, the methods avoid spurious solutions,
points that satisfy the system but not the bounds. Spurious solutions
abound, and do not provide useful information about real solutions,
so it makes sense to exclude them altogether. Given a current iterate
``\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}\right)``
that satisfies ``\left(\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right)>0``,
we can define a _complementary measure_
```math
\nu_{k}=\frac{ \left(\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right)^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}}{p}\,.
```
This measure gives an indication of the desirability of the couple
``\left(\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right)``.

We derive a path-following, primal-dual method by considering the
perturbed KKT conditions by
```math
\vec{F}\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)},\sigma_{k}\nu_{k}\right)=\begin{pmatrix}Q\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)}-\vec{c}\\
Y_{k+1}M_{k+1}\vec{1}-\sigma_{k}\nu_{k}\vec{1}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}+\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)}
\end{pmatrix}=\vec{0}\,,
```
where
```math
Y_{k+1}=\begin{pmatrix}y_{1}^{\left(k+1\right)} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & y_{2}^{\left(k+1\right)} & \ddots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & y_{p}^{\left(k+1\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad M_{k+1}=\begin{pmatrix}\mu_{1}^{\left(k+1\right)} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
0 & \mu_{2}^{\left(k+1\right)} & \ddots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \mu_{p}^{\left(k+1\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,,
```
and ``\sigma\in\left[0,1\right]`` is the reduction factor that we wish
to achieve in the complementary measure on one step. We call ``\sigma``
the _centering parameter_. The solution of this system for all
positive values of ``\sigma`` and ``\nu`` define the _central path_,
which is a trajectory that leads to the solution of the quadratic
program as ``\sigma\nu`` tends to zero.

By fixing ``\sigma_{k}`` and applying Newton's method to the system,
we obtain the linear system
```math
\begin{pmatrix}Q & 0 &  A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T} &  A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\\
0 & M_{k} & 0 & Y_{k}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
A_{\textrm{in}} & I & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\vec{d}_{\vec{x}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\lambda}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}=-\begin{pmatrix}Q\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k\right)}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{c}\\
Y_{k}M_{k}\vec{1}-\sigma_{k}\nu_{k}\vec{1}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}+\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,.
```
We obtain the next iterate by setting
```math
\begin{pmatrix}\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}\\
\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)}\\
\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)}\\
\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}+\alpha_{k}\begin{pmatrix}\vec{d}_{\vec{x}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\lambda}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,,
```
where ``\alpha_{k}`` is chosen to retain the bounds ``\left(\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)}\right)>0``
and possibly to satisfy various other conditions.

The choices of centering parameter ``\sigma_{k}`` and step-length ``\alpha_{k}``
are crucial for the performance of the method. Techniques for controlling
these parameters, directly and indirectly, give rise to a wide variety
of methods with diverse properties. One option is to use equal step
length for the primal and dual updates, and to set ``\alpha_{k}=\min\left\{ \alpha_{k}^{\textrm{pri}},\alpha_{k}^{\textrm{dual}}\right\} ``,
where
```math
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{k}^{\textrm{pri}} & =\max\left\{ \alpha\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} :\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\left(1-\tau\right)\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right\} \,,\\
\alpha_{k}^{\textrm{dual}} & =\max\left\{ \alpha\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} :\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\left(1-\tau\right)\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}\right\} \,,
\end{aligned}
```
the parameter ``\tau\in\left]0,1\right[`` controls how far we back
off from the maximum step for which the conditions ``\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\vec{0}``
and ``\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\vec{0}``
are satisfied. A typical value of ``\tau=0.995`` and we can choose
``\tau_{k}`` to approach ``1`` as the iterates approach the solution,
to accelerate the convergence.

The most popular interior-point method for convex QP is based on Mehrotra's
predictor-corrector. First we compute an affine scaling step ``\left(\vec{d}_{\vec{x},\textrm{aff}},\vec{d}_{\vec{y},\textrm{aff}},\vec{d}_{\vec{\lambda},\textrm{aff}},\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu},\textrm{aff}}\right)``
by setting ``\sigma_{k}=0``. We improve upon this step by computing
a corrector step. Next, we compute the centering parameter ``\sigma_{k}``
using following heuristic
```math
\sigma_{k}=\left(\frac{\nu_{\textrm{aff}}}{\nu_{k}}\right)^{3}\,,
```
where ``\nu_{\textrm{aff}}=\frac{ \left(\vec{y}_{\textrm{aff}}\right)^\mathsf{T}\left(\vec{\mu}_{\textrm{aff}}\right)}{p}``.
The total step is obtained by solving the following system
```math
\begin{pmatrix}Q & 0 &  A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T} &  A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\\
0 & M_{k} & 0 & Y_{k}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
A_{\textrm{in}} & I & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\vec{d}_{\vec{x}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\lambda}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}=-\begin{pmatrix}Q\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k\right)}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{c}\\
Y_{k}M_{k}\vec{1}+\Delta Y_{\textrm{aff}}\Delta M_{\textrm{aff}}\vec{1}-\sigma_{k}\nu_{k}\vec{1}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}+\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,,
```
where
```math
\Delta Y_{\textrm{aff}}=Y_{\textrm{aff}}-Y_{k}\,,\quad\Delta M_{\textrm{aff}}=M_{\textrm{aff}}-M_{k}\,.

#### Example applications
##### Economy

A manufacturer produces  four different  products  $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ and $X_4$. There are three inputs to this production process:

- labor in man weeks,  
- kilograms of raw material A, and 
- boxes  of raw  material  B.

Each product has different input requirements. In determining each  week's production schedule, the manufacturer cannot use more than the available amounts of  manpower and the two raw  materials:

|Inputs|$X_1$|$X_2$|$X_3$|$X_4$|Availabilities|
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
|Person-weeks|1|2|1|2|20|
|Kilograms of material A|6|5|3|2|100|
|Boxes of material B|3|4|9|12|75|
|Production level|$x_1$|$x_2$|$x_3$|$x_4$| |

These constraints can be written in mathematical form

```math
\begin{aligned}
x_1+2x_2+x_3+2x_4\le&20\\
6x_1+5x_2+3x_3+2x_4\le&100\\
3x_1+4x_2+9x_3+12x_4\le&75
\end{aligned}
```

Because negative production levels are not meaningful, we must impose the following nonnegativity constraints on the production levels:

```math
x_i\ge0,\qquad i=1,2,3,4
```

Now suppose that one unit of product $X_1$ sells for €6 and $X_2$, $X_3$ and $X_4$ sell for €4, €7 and €5, respectively. Then, the total revenue for any production decision $\left(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\right)$ is

```math
f\left(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\right)=6x_1+4x_2+7x_3+5x_4
```

The problem is then to maximize $f$ subject to the given constraints.

md"""##### Transportation

A manufacturing company has plants in cities A, B, and C. The company produces and distributes its product to dealers in various cities. On a particular day, the company has 30 units of its product in A, 40 in B, and 30 in C. The company plans to ship 20 units to D, 20 to E, 25 to F, and 35 to G, following orders received from dealers. The transportation costs per unit of each product between the cities are given by

|From|To D|To E|To F|To G|Supply|
|----|----|----|----|----|------|
|A   |7   |10  |14  |8   |30    |
|B   |7   |11  |12  |6   |40    |
|C   |5   |8   |15  |9   |30    |
|Demand|20|20  |25  |35  |100   |

In the table, the quantities supplied and demanded appear at the right and along the bottom of the table. The quantities to be transported from the plants to different destinations are represented by the decision variables.

This problem can be stated in the form:

```math
\min 7x_{AD}+10x_{AE}+14x_{AF}+8x_{AG}+7x_{BD}+11x_{BE}+12x_{BF}+6x_{BG}+5x_{CD}+8x_{CE}+15x_{CF}+9x_{CG}
```

subject to

```math
\begin{aligned}
x_{AD}+x_{AE}+x_{AF}+x_{AG}&=30\\
x_{BD}+x_{BE}+x_{BF}+x_{BG}&=40\\
x_{CD}+x_{CE}+x_{CF}+x_{CG}&=30\\
x_{AD}+x_{BD}+x_{CD}&=20\\
x_{AE}+x_{BE}+x_{CE}&=20\\
x_{AF}+x_{BF}+x_{CF}&=25\\
x_{AG}+x_{BG}+x_{CG}&=35
\end{aligned}
```

In this problem, one of the constraint equations is redundant because it can be derived from the rest of the constraint equations. The mathematical formulation of the transportation problem is then in a linear programming form with twelve (3x4) decision variables and six (3 + 4 - 1) linearly independent constraint equations. Obviously, we also require nonnegativity of the decision variables, since a negative shipment is impossible and does not have any valid interpretation."""

An electric circuit is designed to use a 30 V source to charge 10 V, 6 V, and 20 V batteries connected in parallel. Physical constraints limit the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, and $I_5$ to a maximum of 4 A, 3 A, 3 A, 2 A, and 2 A, respectively. In addition, the batteries must not be discharged, that is, the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, and $I_5$ must not be negative. We wish to find the values of the currents $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, and $I_5$ such that the total power transferred to the batteries is maximized.

The total power transferred to the batteries is the sum of the powers transferred to each battery, and is given by $10I_2 + 6I_4 + 20I_5$ W. From the circuit, we observe that the currents satisfy the constraints $I_1 = I_2 + I_3$, and $I_3 = I_4 + I_5$. Therefore, the problem can be posed as the following linear program:

### Quadratic progamming
!!! info "Quadratic progam"
	An optimization problem with a quadratic objective function and linear
	constraints is called a _quadratic program_. Problems of this
	type are important in their own right, and they also arise a subproblems
	in methods for general constrained optimization such as sequential
	quadratic programming and interior-point methods.
	
	The general quadratic program can be stated as
	
	```math
	\begin{aligned}
	\min_{\vec{x}}\, & f\left(\vec{x}\right)\overset{\vartriangle}{=}\frac{1}{2}\vec{x}^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{x}-\vec{c}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}\\
	\textrm{subject to}\, & \begin{cases}
	A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}=\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\,,\\
	A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}\leq\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\,,
	\end{cases}
	\end{aligned}
	```
	
	where $Q$ is a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix, $\vec{c}\in\mathbb R^{n}$,
	$A_{\textrm{eq}}$ is a $m\times n$ matrix, $\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\in\mathbb R^{m}$,
	$A_{\textrm{in}}$ is a $p\times n$ matrix and $\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\in\mathbb R^{p}$.
	If the Hessian matrix $Q$ is positive semidefinite, we have a convex
	quadratic program. Non-convex quadratic programs, in which $Q$ is
	an indefinite matrix, can be more challenging because they have several
	stationary points and local minima.

We consider the following equality-constrained quadratic problem:
```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\vec{x}}\, & f\left(\vec{x}\right)\overset{\vartriangle}{=}\frac{1}{2} \vec{x}^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{x}- \vec{c}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}\\
\textrm{subject to}\, & A\vec{x}=\vec{b}\,,\nonumber 
\end{aligned}
```
where $A$ is the $m\times n$ Jacobian of constraints and $\vec{b}\in\mathbb R^{m}$.
We assume that $A$ has rank $m$ so that the constraints are consistent.

The First Order Necessary Condition (FONC) uses the Langrangian function
```math
\mathcal L\left(\vec x, \vec \lambda\right)=\vec{x}^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{x}- \vec{c}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x} + \vec\lambda^\mathsf{T} \left(A\vec{x}-\vec{b}\right)
```
and gives the following condition
```math
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{\vec x}\mathcal L\left(\vec x ^\star, \vec \lambda ^\star\right)&=\vec 0\,,\\
\nabla_{\vec \lambda}\mathcal L\left(\vec x ^\star, \vec \lambda ^\star\right)&=\vec 0\,,
\end{aligned}
```
So the FONC for $\vec{x}^{\star}$ to be a solution of the quadratic
problem yields a vector $\vec{\lambda}^{\star}$ such
that the following system of equations is satisfied:
```math
\begin{pmatrix}Q & A^\mathsf{T}\\
A & 0
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\vec{x}^{\star}\\
\vec{\lambda}^{\star}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\vec{c}\\
\vec{b}
\end{pmatrix}\,.
```
This system can be solved directly by factorization. An alternative
is to use an iterative method.

**Example**
Consider the quadratic programming problem

```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\vec{x}}\, & \frac{1}{2} \vec{x}^\mathsf{T}\begin{pmatrix}6 & 2 & 1\\

end)


We refer the constraints, in order, by indices ``1`` through ``5``.

For this problem it is easy to determine a feasible initial point;
say ``\vec{x}^{\left(0\right)}=\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0\end{pmatrix}^{\mathsf{T}}``.

Constraints ``3`` and ``5`` are active at this point, and we set ``W_{0}=\left\{ 3,5\right\} ``.
Note that we could just as validly have chosen ``W_{0}=\left\{ 5\right\} ``
or ``W_{0}=\left\{ 3\right\} `` or even ``W_{0}=\emptyset``. Each choice
would lead the algorithm to perform somewhat differently.

```julia
x₀ = [2, 0]
let x = x₀
	g = Q*x - c
	ain = [reshape(A[3,:], 1, 2); reshape(A[5,:], 1, 2)]
	sol = [Q transpose(ain)
		   ain zeros(2,2)] \ [-g; 0; 0]
end					   
```

Since ``\vec{x}^{\left(0\right)}`` lies on a vertex of the feasible
region, it is obviously a minimizer of the objective function ``f``
with respect to the working set ``W_{0}``; that is, the solution of
the subproblem with ``k=0`` is ``\vec{d}^{\left(0\right)}=\vec{0}``.
We can then find the multipliers ``\mu_{3}^{\circ}`` and ``\mu_{5}^{\circ}``
associated with the active constraints. Substitution of the data from
our problem yields
```math
\begin{pmatrix}-1\\
2
\end{pmatrix}\lambda_{3}^{\circ}+\begin{pmatrix}0\\
1
\end{pmatrix}\lambda_{5}^{\circ}=\begin{pmatrix}2\\
-5
\end{pmatrix}\,,
```
which has solution ``\lambda_{3}^{\circ}=-2`` and ``\lambda_{5}^{\circ}=-1``. 

We now remove constraint ``3`` from the working set, because it has
the most negative multiplier, and set ``W_{1}=\{5\}``.

```julia
sol₁ = let x = x₀
	g = Q*x - c
	ain = reshape(A[5,:], 1, 2)
	sol = [Q transpose(ain)
		   ain zeros(1,1)] \ [-g; 0]
end
```
```
sol₁ = [-1.2, 0.0, -5.0]
```

We begin iteration ``1`` by finding the solution of the subproblem for ``k=1``, which is
``\vec{d}^{\left(1\right)}= \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``.

```julia
α₁, d₁ = let x = x₀
	d = sol₁[1:2]
	α = min(1.0, [(reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * d)[1,1] ≤ 0 ? 1.0 : ((b[j] .- reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * x) / (reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * d))[1,1] for j in (1,2,3,4)]...)
	α, d
end
```			
```
(1.0, [-1.0, 0.0])
```


The step-length formula yields ``\alpha_{1}=1``, and the new iterate
is ``\vec{x}^{\left(2\right)}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``. There are no blocking constraints, so that ``W_{2}=W_{1}=\left\{ 5\right\}``

```julia
x₁ = x₀ + α₁ .* d₁ # [1.0, 0.0]
sol₂ = let x = x₁
	g = Q*x - c
	ain = reshape(A[5,:], 1, 2)
	sol = [Q transpose(ain)
		   ain zeros(1,1)] \ [-g; 0]
end						   
```		
```
sol₂ = [0.0, 0.0, -5.0]
```

We find at the start of iteration ``2`` that the solution of the
subproblem is ``\vec{d}^{\left(2\right)}=\vec{0}``. We deduce that
the Lagrange multiplier for the lone working constraint is ``\lambda_{5}^{\circ}=-5``,
so we drop the working set to obtain ``W_{3}=\emptyset``.						   

```julia
x₂ = x₁ # [1.0, 0.0]
sol₃ = let x = x₂
	g = Q*x - c
	sol = Q \ (-g)
end				   
```		
```
sol₃ = [-0.0, 2.5]
```				

Iteration ``3`` starts by solving the unconstrained problem, to obtain
the solution ``\vec{d}^{\left(3\right)}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 2.5\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``.	

```julia
α₃, d₃ = let x = x₂
	d = sol₃[1:2]
	α = min(1.0, [(reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * d)[1,1] ≤ 0 ? 1.0 : ((b[j] .- reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * x) / (reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * d))[1,1] for j in (1,2,3,4,5)]...)
	α, d
end
```						   
```
(0.6, [-0.0, 2.5])
```
The step-length formula yields a step length of ``\alpha_{3}=0.6``
and a new iterate ``\vec{x}^{\left(4\right)}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1.5\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``. There
is a single blocking constraint (constraint ``1``), so we obtain ``W_{4}=\left\{ 1\right\}``.						   

```julia
x₃ = x₂ + α₃ .* d₃ # [1.0, 1.5]
sol₄ = let x=x₃
	g = Q*x - c
	ain = reshape(A[1,:], 1, 2)
	sol = [Q transpose(ain)
		   ain zeros(1,1)] \ [-g; 0]
end
```						   
```
[0.4, 0.2, 0.8]
```
The solution of the subproblem for ``k=4`` is then ``\vec{d}^{\left(4\right)}=\begin{pmatrix}0.4 & 0.2\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``.						   

```julia
α₄, d₄ = let x = x₃
	d = sol₄[1:2]
	α = min(1.0, [(reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * d)[1,1] ≤ 0 ? 1.0 : ((b[j] .- reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * x) / (reshape(A[j,:], 1, 2) * d))[1,1] for j in (2,3,4,5)]...)
	α, d
end						   
```						   
```
(1.0, [0.4, 0.2])
```
The new step-length is ``1``. There are no blocking constraints
on this step, so the next working set in unchanged: ``W_{5}=\left\{ 1\right\} ``. The new iterate is ``\vec{x}^{\left(5\right)}=\begin{pmatrix}1.4 & 1.7\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``.	

```julia
x₄ = x₃ + α₄ .* d₄ # [1.4, 1.7]
sol₅ = let x = x₄
	g = Q*x - c
	ain = reshape(A[1,:], 1, 2)
	sol = [Q transpose(ain)
		   ain zeros(1,1)] \ [-g; 0]
end
```						   
```
[0.0, 0.0, 0.8]
```						   
						   	
Finally, we solve the subproblem for ``k=5`` to obtain a solution ``\vec{d}^{\left(5\right)}=\vec{0}``.
We find a multiplier ``\mu_{1}^{\circ}=0.8``, so we have found the
solution. Wet set ``\vec{x}^{\star}=\begin{pmatrix}1.4 & 1.7\end{pmatrix}^\mathsf{T}``
and terminate.

 \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}=b_{\textrm{in},j}\,, & \forall j\in J\left(\vec{x}^{\star}\right)\,,
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```
where ``\vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}`` is the ``j``th row in the matrix ``A_{\textrm{in}}``
and ``b_{\textrm{in},j}`` is the ``j``th element of the vector ``\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}``.
Of course, we usually do not have prior knowledge of ``J\left(\vec{x}^{\star}\right)``
and determination of this set is the main challenge facing algorithms
for inequality-constrained quadratic programs.

Active-set methods find a step from one iterate to the next by solving
a quadratic subproblem in which some of the inequality constraints,
and all the equality constraints are imposed as equalities. This subset
is referred to as the _working set_ and is denoted at the ``k``th
iterate by ``W_{k}``. An important requirement we impose on ``W_{k}``
is that the gradients ``\vec{a}_{\textrm{eq},i}``, ``i=1,\dots,m`` and
``\vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}``, ``j\in W_{k}`` are linearly independent,
even when the full set of active constraints at that point has linearly
dependent gradients.

Given an iterate ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}`` and the working set ``W_{k}``,
we first check whether ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}`` minimizes the quadratic
function ``f`` in the subspace defined by the working set. If not,
we compute a step ``\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}`` by solving an equality-constrained
quadratic subproblem in which the inequality constraints corresponding
to the working set ``W_{k}`` are regarded as equalities and the other
inequality constraints are temporarily disregarded. To express this
subproblem in terms of the step ``\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}``, we define
```math
\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}=\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}-\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}\,,\quad\vec{g}_{k}=Q\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{c}\,.
```
By substituting for ``\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}`` into the objective
function, we find that
```math
f\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}\right)=f\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\right)^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}+\vec{g}_{k}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}+\rho_{k}\,,
```
where ``\rho_{k}=\frac{1}{2} \left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}\right)^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}- \vec{c}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}``
is independent of ``\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}``. Since we can drop ``\rho_{k}``
from the objective function without changing the solution of the problem,
we can write the subproblem to be solved at the ``k``th iteration as
follows
```math
    \min_{\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}} \frac{1}{2} \left(\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\right)^\mathsf{T}Q\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}+ \vec{g}_{k}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)} \text{ subject to}
    \begin{cases}
        A_{\text{eq}}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}=\vec{0} \\
        \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}=0
    \end{cases}
    , \forall j\in W_{k}
```


Note that for each ``j\in W_{k}``, the value of `` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}``
does not change as we move along ``\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}``, since
we have `` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\right)= \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}=b_{\textrm{in},j}``
for all ``\alpha``. Since the constraints in ``W_{k}`` were satisfied
at ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}``, they are also satisfied at ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}``,
for any value of ``\alpha``.

Supposing for the moment that the optimal ``\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}``
is nonzero, we need to decide how far to move along this direction.
If ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}`` is feasible
with respect to all the constraints, we set ``\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}=\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}``.
Otherwise, we set
```math
\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}=\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha_{k}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\,,
```
where the step-length parameter ``\alpha_{k}`` is chosen to be the
largest value in the range ``\left[0,1\right]`` for which all constraints
are satisfied. We can derive an explicit definition of ``\alpha_{k}``
by considering what happens to the constraints ``j\notin W_{k}``, since
the constraints ``j\in W_{k}`` will certainly be satisfied regardless
of the choice of ``\alpha_{k}``. If `` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\leq0``
for some ``j\notin W_{k}``, then for all ``\alpha_{k}\geq0``, we have
`` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha_{k}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\right)\leq \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}\leq b_{\textrm{in},j}``.
Hence, constraint ``j`` will be satisfied for all nonnegative choices
of the step-length parameter. Whenever `` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}>0``
for some ``j\notin W_{k}``, however, we have that `` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha_{k}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}\right)\leq b_{\textrm{in},j}``
only if
```math
\alpha_{k}\leq\frac{b_{\textrm{in},j}- \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}}{ \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}}\,.
```
To maximize the decrease in ``f``, we want ``\alpha_{k}`` to be as large
as possible in ``\left[0,1\right]`` subject to retaining feasibility,
so we obtain the following definition
```math
\alpha_{k}\overset{\textrm{def}}{=}\min\left\{ 1,\min_{j\notin W_{k}, \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}>0}\frac{b_{\textrm{in},j}- \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}}{ \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}}\right\} \,.
```
We call the constraints ``j`` for which this minimum is achieved the
_blocking constraints_. Note that it is quite possible for ``\alpha_{k}``
to be zero, because we could have `` \vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}^\mathsf{T}\vec{d}^{\left(k\right)}>0``
for some constraint ``j`` that is active at ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}``
but not a member of the current working set ``W_{k}``.

If ``\alpha_{k}<1``, that is, the step along ``\vec{d}_{k}`` was blocked
by some constraint not in ``W_{k}``, a new working set ``W_{k+1}`` is
constructed by adding one of the blocking constraints to ``W_{k}``.
We continue to iterate in this manner, adding constraints to the working
set until the subproblem has solution ``\vec{d}^{\circ}=\vec{0}``.
Since ``\vec{d}^{\circ}=\vec{0}`` satisfy the optimality condition, we have that
```math
\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_{i}^{\circ}\vec{a}_{\textrm{eq},i}+\sum_{j\in W^{\circ}}\mu_{j}^{\circ}\vec{a}_{\textrm{in},j}=-\vec{g}^{\circ}=-Q\vec{x}^{\circ}+\vec{c}\,,
```
for some Lagrange multipliers ``\lambda_{i}^{\circ}``, ``i=1,\dots,m``
and ``\mu_{j}^{\circ}``, ``j\in W^{\circ}``. It follows that ``\vec{x}^{\circ}``,
``\vec{\lambda}^{\circ}`` and ``\vec{\mu}^{\circ}`` satisfy the second
KKT condition, if we define the multipliers corresponding to the inequality
constraints not in the working set to be zero. Because of the control
imposed on the step length, ``\vec{x}^{\circ}`` is also feasible with
respect to all the constraints, so the third, fourth and fifth KKT
conditions are satisfied at this point.

We now examine the signs of the KKT multipliers in the working set,
that is, the indices ``j\in W^{\circ}``. If these conditions are all
nonnegative, the first KKT condition is also satisfied, so we conclude
that ``\vec{x}^{\circ}`` is a KKT point for the original problem. In
fact, since ``Q`` is positive semidefinite, we have that ``\vec{x}^{\circ}``
is a global minimum.

If, on the other hand, on or more of the multipliers ``\mu_{j}^{\circ}``,
``j\in W^{\circ}``, are negative, the first KKT condition is not satisfied
and the objective function ``f`` may be decreased by dropping one of
these constraints. Thus, we remove an index ``j`` corresponding to
one of the negative multipliers from the working set and solve a new
subproblem for the next step. While any index ``j`` for which ``\mu_{j}^{\circ}<0``
usually will yield in a direction ``\vec{d}`` along which the algorithm
can make progress, the most negative multiplier is often chosen in
practice. This choice is motived by a sensitivity analysis, which
shows that the rate of decrease in the objective function when one
constraint is removed, is proportional to the magnitude of the Lagrange
multiplier for that constraint.

### General constrained optimisation
We can now return to the general optimisation problem from the introduction:
```math
\begin{aligned}
\min\, & f\left(\vec{x}\right)\\
\textrm{subject to} & \begin{cases}
\vec{h}\left(\vec{x}\right)=\vec{0}\\
\vec{g}\left(\vec{x}\right)\leq\vec{0}

where $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $\vec{h}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$,
$m\leq n$, and $\vec{g}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{p}$.

!!! info "Sequential quadratic programming (SQP)"
	The idea behind the this approach is to model the general problem at the current iterate ``\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}`` by a quadratic programming subproblem, then use the minimizer of this subproblem to define a new iterate ``\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}``. 

The challenge is to design the quadratic subproblem so that it yields a good step for the general optimization problem.

"""

Applying Newton's method to the Lagrangian function and linearizing
both the equality and the inequality constraints yields the following
subproblem

```

where $\mu_{j}^{\left(k\right)}=0$, for all
$j\notin W_{k}$. We can use the active-set method for quadratic programming
to solve this subproblem. The new iterate is given by $\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}$,
$\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)}$, $\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)}$
and $W_{k+1}$.

If the SQP method is able to identify the optimal active set then
it will act like a Newton method for equality-constrained optimization
and will converge rapidly.

It is also remarkable that, far from the solution, the SQP approach
is usually able to improve the estimate of the active set and guide
the iterates towards a solution.

Non-quadratic objective functions, however, can impede progress of
the SQP algorithm, a phenomenon known as the Maratos effect. Steps
that make good progress toward a solution are rejected and the algorithm
fails to converge rapidly. These difficulties can be overcome by means
of a _second-order correction_.""")

where ``Q`` is a symmetric and positive semidefinite ``n\times n`` matrix,
``\vec{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}``, ``A_{\textrm{eq}}`` is a ``m\times n`` matrix,
``\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}``, ``A_{\textrm{in}}`` is a ``p\times n``
matrix and ``\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\in\mathbb{R}^{p}``. Rewriting the KKT

A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x} & \leq\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}\,.

A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}+\vec{y} & =\vec{0}\,.

```
Since we assume that ``Q`` is positive semidefinite, these KKT conditions
are not only necessary but also sufficient, so we can solve the convex
quadratic program by finding solutions of this system.

Primal-dual methods generate iterates that satisfy the bounds strictly; that is, ``\vec{y}>0``
and ``\vec{\mu}>0``. This property is the origin of the term interior-point.
By respecting these bounds, the methods avoid spurious solutions,
points that satisfy the system but not the bounds. Spurious solutions
abound, and do not provide useful information about real solutions,
so it makes sense to exclude them altogether. Given a current iterate
``\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}\right)``
that satisfies ``\left(\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right)>0``,
we can define a _complementary measure_
```math
\nu_{k}=\frac{ \left(\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right)^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}}{p}\,.
```
This measure gives an indication of the desirability of the couple
``\left(\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right)``.

We derive a path-following, primal-dual method by considering the
perturbed KKT conditions by
```math
\vec{F}\left(\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)},\sigma_{k}\nu_{k}\right)=\begin{pmatrix}Q\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)}-\vec{c}\\

0 & y_{2}^{\left(k+1\right)} & \ddots & 0\\

\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \mu_{p}^{\left(k+1\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,,
```
and ``\sigma\in\left[0,1\right]`` is the reduction factor that we wish
to achieve in the complementary measure on one step. We call ``\sigma``
the _centering parameter_. The solution of this system for all
positive values of ``\sigma`` and ``\nu`` define the _central path_,
which is a trajectory that leads to the solution of the quadratic
program as ``\sigma\nu`` tends to zero.

By fixing ``\sigma_{k}`` and applying Newton's method to the system,
we obtain the linear system
```math
\begin{pmatrix}Q & 0 &  A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T} &  A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\\

We obtain the next iterate by setting
```math
\begin{pmatrix}\vec{x}^{\left(k+1\right)}\\
\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)}\\
\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k+1\right)}\\
\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)}

\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}\,,
```
where ``\alpha_{k}`` is chosen to retain the bounds ``\left(\vec{\mu}^{\left(k+1\right)},\vec{y}^{\left(k+1\right)}\right)>0``
and possibly to satisfy various other conditions.

The choices of centering parameter ``\sigma_{k}`` and step-length ``\alpha_{k}``
are crucial for the performance of the method. Techniques for controlling
these parameters, directly and indirectly, give rise to a wide variety
of methods with diverse properties. One option is to use equal step
length for the primal and dual updates, and to set ``\alpha_{k}=\min\left\{ \alpha_{k}^{\textrm{pri}},\alpha_{k}^{\textrm{dual}}\right\} ``,
where
```math
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{k}^{\textrm{pri}} & =\max\left\{ \alpha\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} :\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\left(1-\tau\right)\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}\right\} \,,\\
\alpha_{k}^{\textrm{dual}} & =\max\left\{ \alpha\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} :\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\left(1-\tau\right)\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}\right\} \,,
\end{aligned}
```
the parameter ``\tau\in\left]0,1\right[`` controls how far we back
off from the maximum step for which the conditions ``\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\vec{0}``
and ``\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}+\alpha\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}\geq\vec{0}``
are satisfied. A typical value of ``\tau=0.995`` and we can choose
``\tau_{k}`` to approach ``1`` as the iterates approach the solution,
to accelerate the convergence.

The most popular interior-point method for convex QP is based on Mehrotra's
predictor-corrector. First we compute an affine scaling step ``\left(\vec{d}_{\vec{x},\textrm{aff}},\vec{d}_{\vec{y},\textrm{aff}},\vec{d}_{\vec{\lambda},\textrm{aff}},\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu},\textrm{aff}}\right)``
by setting ``\sigma_{k}=0``. We improve upon this step by computing
a corrector step. Next, we compute the centering parameter ``\sigma_{k}``
using following heuristic
```math
\sigma_{k}=\left(\frac{\nu_{\textrm{aff}}}{\nu_{k}}\right)^{3}\,,
```
where ``\nu_{\textrm{aff}}=\frac{ \left(\vec{y}_{\textrm{aff}}\right)^\mathsf{T}\left(\vec{\mu}_{\textrm{aff}}\right)}{p}``.
The total step is obtained by solving the following system
```math
\begin{pmatrix}Q & 0 &  A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T} &  A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\\
0 & M_{k} & 0 & Y_{k}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
A_{\textrm{in}} & I & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\vec{d}_{\vec{x}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{y}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\lambda}}^{\left(k\right)}\\
\vec{d}_{\vec{\mu}}^{\left(k\right)}
\end{pmatrix}=-\begin{pmatrix}Q\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}+ A_{\textrm{eq}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\lambda}^{\left(k\right)}+ A_{\textrm{in}}^\mathsf{T}\vec{\mu}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{c}\\
Y_{k}M_{k}\vec{1}+\Delta Y_{\textrm{aff}}\Delta M_{\textrm{aff}}\vec{1}-\sigma_{k}\nu_{k}\vec{1}\\
A_{\textrm{eq}}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{eq}}\\
A_{\textrm{in}}\vec{x}^{\left(k\right)}-\vec{b}_{\textrm{in}}+\vec{y}^{\left(k\right)}

```math

## Stochastic optimisation
We have seen that most algorithm follow a greedy approach, and will find the optimum closest to the initial point, which can lead to us being stuck in a local optimum. This problem can be overcome by adding randomness to help escape local optima and increase the chances of finding a global optimum.

!!! info "Stochastic Optimisation"
	Stochastic optimisation refers to methods that incorporate randomness to improve the search for optimal solutions, particularly to escape local optima and increase the likelihood of finding a global optimum. These methods are useful when the objective function is complex, non-convex, or has multiple local optima. Randomness is often introduced via techniques like random perturbations, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms.

	Formally, stochastic optimisation can be described as:
	```math
	\min_{\vec{x} \in \Omega} f(\vec{x})
	```
	where randomness is used in the algorithm (e.g., random sampling or stochastic gradients) to explore the solution space ``\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n``, and ``f : \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}`` is the objective function.

!!! danger "Heads up!"
	1. Stochastic methods trade determinism for robustness, often requiring more computational effort but improving global convergence.
	2. Proper tuning of randomness (e.g., step sizes or mutation rates) is critical to balance exploration and exploitation.

### Particle Swarm Optimisation

!!! info "Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)"
	Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is a stochastic optimisation method inspired by the social behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish. It uses a population of particles, each representing a candidate solution, that move through the search space based on their own best-known position and the swarm's global best position. Randomness in velocity updates helps particles escape local optima, increasing the likelihood of finding a global optimum.

	Each particle's velocity is updated as:
	```math
	\vec{v}_i \gets w \vec{v}_i + c_1 r_1 (\vec{x}_{\text{best},i} - \vec{x}_i) + c_2 r_2 (\vec{x}_{\text{best}} - \vec{x}_i)
	```
	```math
	\vec{x}_i \gets \vec{x}_i + \vec{v}_i
	```
	where $\vec{v}_i$ is the velocity, $\vec{x}_{\text{best},i}$ is the particle $i$'s best position, $\vec{x}_{\text{best}}$ is the global best position, $w$ is the inertia weight, $c_1, c_2$ are parameters, and $r_1, r_2 \sim U(0,1)$ are random numbers.

	**Notes**:
	1. PSO is effective for non-convex, multimodal problems but may require careful tuning of parameters $w,c_1, c_2$ to balance exploration and convergence.
	2. The algorithm’s performance depends on the initial particle distribution and the complexity of the objective function.

## Optimisation of stochastic functions
!!! info "Optimisation of Stochastic Functions"
	This refers to optimisation problems where the objective function or constraints involve randomness, such as when \(f(\vec{x})\) is an expected value or involves noisy measurements. Examples include optimising systems under uncertainty (e.g., financial models, machine learning). The goal is to minimise the expected value of the objective function:
	```math
	\min_{\vec{x} \in \Omega} \mathbb{E}[f(\vec{x}, \omega)]
	```
	subject to constraints that may also be stochastic:

	where $\omega$ represents random variables, and expectations are taken over their distributions.



!!! danger "Heads up!"
	1. Estimating the expected value of the objective function typically requires running multiple samples or simulations, which can be computationally expensive.
	2. Stochastic optimisation may not always guarantee a global optimum due to the noise, but it can often find a good solution given the randomness in the system.
	3. Defining the stochastic components (e.g., probability distributions) accurately is crucial for meaningful solutions.
	4. As the number of stochastic dimensions increases, suitable sampling approaches should be selected to keep the sampling computationally tractable.

In practive however, both the material properties of the beam as well as the loads it is subjected to can be variable. This problem is typical in engineering, where real-world conditions often introduce variability. In current building norms, this is covered by using safety coefficients that will underestimate the material properties and overestimate the load.

We also want the deflection of the beam must stay within limits, which is computed using a simplified beam deflection formula, subject to randomness in material properties (e.g., Young's modulus) and load (e.g., applied force).

	* The jammer assets need to stay within a 300km range from the carrier;
	* The EWR ``j`` receives an instantaneous power density from jammer ``h`` as follows:
	  ```math
	  S_{hj}(\omega) = \frac{P_h}{4\pi d_{hj}^2} \kappa(\omega),

	* The jammers have a limited amount of fuel (7 tonnes). For a specific loiter point for asset ``h``, the fuel consumption can be modelled as follows:
	  ```math
	  F_h = 1.2 + 0.06 d_h + 2 P_h^{1.3},

\max_{x_h, y_h, P_h} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{s=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{3} \left( \sum_{h=1}^{2}\frac{P_h \kappa_s}{4\pi d_{hj}^2} - S_{\text{min}} \right)_{+},
```
where $h$ indicates the index of the EW assets, $j$ indicates the index of the EWRs, and $s$ indicates the index of atmospheric conduct parameter. The notation $(\cdot)_+ = \max{(0, \cdot)}$, this makes sure that the residual value is positive.
"""
	EW_obj = PlutoUI.details("Objective function", EW_obj_content, open=false)
	
EW_constraints_content = md"""
Again, assuming we are using the sampling approach, we can write the constraint related to the suppression of the EWRs as follows:
```math
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{s=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}\left( \sum_{h=1}^{2}\frac{P_h \kappa_s}{4\pi d_{hj}^2} \ge S_{\text{min}} \right) \ge 0.9 \;\; \forall j = 1,2,3.
```
In the above equation, $\mathbf{1}$ is the [indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function), which returns one if the argument is true, and zero otherwise.

The fuel constraints are obtained almost directly from the problem statement:
```math
1.2 + 0.06 d_h + 2 P_h^{1.3} \le 7  \;\; \forall h = 1,2.
```

The emission constraints are also directly obtained:
```math
0 \le P_h \le 6  \;\; \forall h = 1,2.
```	

Finally, we should also make sure our assest remain within recoverable distance of the carrier:
```math
0 \le \sqrt{(x_h - x_c)^2 + (y_c - y_c)^2} \le 300  \;\; \forall h = 1,2.
```	
In the above equation $(x_c, y_c)$ refers to the carrier position.
