## Wargaming
Wargaming is a tool for analyzing strategic decision-making in conflict scenarios. By digitizing a wargame model, we can run rapid simulations and perform statistical analysis on various strategies. Several wargames (boardgames) are made available by DefCol. Having this readily available would be very helpful for both educators and trainees. Moreover, when done properly, this could even be combined with reinforcement learning, to obtain the "perfect strategist".
Analysis could include the use of statistical methods to identify successful strategies under different conditions.

**Note:** multiple projects possible

## Computer networks
Computer networks rely on multiple layers, each with unique protocols and constraints. Modeling and simulating these networks allows us to analyze performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize communication pathways. Projects in this area may focus on network performance under various conditions or on simulating specific protocols to analyze effectiveness and limitations. 

For example, you can study a specific  network layer or protocol, such as transport layer protocols (TCP, UDP), routing in the network layer, or specific application protocols. You can then focus on practical relevance, such as enhancing data throughput, minimizing latency, or optimizing packet routing. Additionally, load balancing in networks can also be studied.

## Opinion dynamics
People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with each other. Mathematics (including graph theory) can be used to study opinion changes in simplifications of real-life situations, and explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. These models can help us learn how to promote the spread of accurate information and reduce the spread of inaccurate information.

## Mission planning of a CubeSat
The KU Leuven is building a Small modular satellite (this type is also known as a CubeSat) named CubeSpec to perform asteroseismology of massive stars from a low earth orbit (a satellite circling the earth at an altitude of roughly 500 km). For this purpose the spectrograph must be pointed accurately at these massive stars given a minimal exposure time and an appurtenant revisit frequency. Knowing the mission priorities, an ordered target list is provided. In an ICRF (inertial celestial reference frame) system, these targets remain fixed in position. Using the available packages for orbit propagation, use discrete event simulation and optimisation to find if the minimal mission criteria are respected.

## Downlinking Geo Intelligence Data
An Earth sensing satellite such as CSO (Composante Spatiale Optique) collects geo-intelligence images over areas of interest to the intelligence services. When it overflies a region of interest, it captures images. As soon as the satellite has collected this information, it must be downlinked to a ground-station in allied territory. This can be done when the satellite overflies a region within sight of the station.

Satellite properties: You can find or estimate the image processing time, the maximal on-board memory, the required downlink time and bandwith and the orbit characteristics of such a satellite.

Use this information to answer the question related to a (semi-) realistic scenario: Imagine we wish to gain information related to the activities of a given dictator in a given Corean country (e.g. when he takes his train). Imagine the only ground station is located in France (Toulouse). When would we be able to acquire this information in Belgium? What would be the amount of images we can downlink? Would one ground station suffice? Is it interesting to use one of France's oversea territories to place a second ground station? What would be the impact? Perform a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate these impacts.

## Airport Ground Handling
Simulate the turnaround process for airplanes at an airport (unloading and loading passengers, refueling, baggage handling, etc.) Minimize the total turnover time while making sure that all conditions are met. Introduce disturbances such as random delays (e.g. mechanical issues). Once the individual plane process is in place, zoom out to a small scale airport and cover the overall process.

## Supermarket Checkout Simulation
You have witnessed the tendency to start placing self-checkouts at supermarkets to increase efficiency and reduce the needed staff. Whilst they do not need a dedicated employee per register, they do need one for oversight, in aiding the client in case of problems or to perform random checks. You also have shops where you can scan your items whilst doing shopping.

Construct a model for this purpose that represents as closely as possible a real-life scenario with conventional registers and self checkouts. Use e.g. a nearby shop for inspiration. Try to maximise efficiency and reduce the total cost, whilst keeping track of customer satisfaction.

## Public Transit System Simulation
Take the layout of the subway/tube/undergound public transit system of a major city of your liking. Choose a city of which there is reference to this information. Try to find, using a given number of stops and crowd density (in function of a timetable) an optimal schedule to limit passenger waiting times and overcrowding.

## Train Station Simulation
The Brussels North-South connection is the bussiest railroad of the country. Almost 1/3 of all Belgian trains pass through this station on a daily basis. The biggest bottleneck is the station of Brussels-Central, where only 6 tracks are available. Place yourself in the position of a train traffic manager and find a way to run the station as efficiently as possible. For actual data, refer to the website of the NMBS/SNCB. Bear in mind that not all trains are equally important. International trains will have priority over local trains.

As you will have discovered by now, trains often tend to be delayed due to a variety of reasons: persons on the tracks, malfunctions in the signaling, trains broken down, etc. Find a way to model these disturbances and percieve the backlash of such an event. Use this to perform a sensitivity analysis.

## Electric Car Charging
The amount of electric cars in all sorts and sizes is strongly increasing. These cars all need to be charged when not in use, demanding high amounts of power from the grid. Knowing that these cars are usually used for commuting, their battery only needs to be recharged partially or every few days. You will have users who like to always leave the garage with a full charge, others will be less disciplined.

Construct a model indicating the amount of power required by these cars and the strain it puts on the electricity grid. Consider the case of a brown out (almost no electricity produced by neither wind nor solar (cloudy and windless day)) where still the cars need to be recharged. Make predictions pertaining to the evolution of the amount of cars in the coming years and the addition of solar arrays. Is our current supply equipped to deal with this evolution?

## Traffic Flow Optimization (Oosterweel)
In the list of the 2023 topics, you can find following concept:

*Traffic congestion is a common problem in urban areas. Mathematical modeling and simulation can be used to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve overall transportation efficiency. 
This project could involve modeling traffic patterns, simulating different traffic management strategies, and identifying the most effective solutions. Additionaly, you might also consider
the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on traffic flow.*

**Update:** Revise this idea and apply it to the evolution of the 'Oosterweel' works around Antwerp. E.g. a temporary bridge (the bypass) is currently under construction to be able to bring down the old bridge. Knowing the trafic flows in and around Antwerp, this reduced capacity will have a (near) devastating impact on mobility. Prove this by using simulation. Make predictions of the impact of other stages of the works (the opening of the tunnel) on the overall car/truck mobility in and around Antwerp. Make your study with horizon 2033.

## Sports Tournament Scheduling and Optimization
Model the scheduling and logistics of a sports tournament (e.g. the World Cup Football) with multiple teams, venues and constraints (resting days, availability). Optimize the schedule to ensure fairness, minimize travel distance/cost and maximize the audience engagement (i.e. accessibility for a geographically dispersed audience at reasonable timeslots). Also consider constraints such as unexpected delays, possible withdrawals, extra time and broadcasting limitations.

## Optimizing RMA services
Different services within the RMA are managed by Sodexo (restaurant, kitchen, bar, cleaning, gardening etc.). When modeled properly, you can use simulation to optimize the use of resources (personnel, equipment, etc.) or identify bottlenecks for these services. 
The local Sodexo manager is willing to cooperate and provide data and insights in the current situation. Different projects are possible, depending on your interest. 
1. The flux and waiting times in the mess hall: ss the number of people on the site of the RMA is steadily increasing, this poses additional challenges in terms of the organization of the flow of the people coming in for breakfast/lunch/dinner. For this setting, you could combine:
    * historical data (provided)
    * a comprehensive analysis of the flows and the processes of the mess hall (provided + own insights)
    * an accurate estimate of client arrival (provided/own insights)
    to determine the bottlenecks in the current layout and propose innovative solutions (e.g. layout modifications, extensions, staffing…) to reduce the time spent “in the system”.
2. The cafeteria of the RMA (bar) is used for different activities: coffee breaks in the morning, sandwiches at lunch, receptions related to activities and serving drinks in the evening to the people on site. Like the mess hall, this system is increasingly being stressed due to increased demand. For this setting, you could combine:
    * historical data (provided)
    * a comprehensive analysis of the flows and the processes of cafeteria (provided + own insights)
    * an accurate estimate of client arrival (provided/own insights)
    to determine the bottlenecks in the current layout and propose innovative solutions (e.g. layout modifications, extensions, staffing, planning…) to reduce the time spent “in the system”.
3. The entire RMA needs regular housekeeping. The specific requirements vary in function of the size of the room, its flooring (carpet/tiles/other), the cleaning technique etc. There are some guidelines and data available regarding the time required for cleaning. The location where the equipment is stored, as well as the schedule can have a significant impact on the total time spent cleaning. For this setting you could consider:
    * the actual composition of the rooms (size, flooring etc.)
    * the current approach to scheduling the housekeeping
    * expert knowledge regarding time spent on cleaning
    * historical data to simulate occasional occupation
    to determine where potential gains can be made to reduce the total time spent on housekeeping.

## Renewable energy production
Wind farms are used to generate renewable energy. Both wind direction and wind strength are variable. To account for this, one can adjust the orientation of the wind turbines so that they are perpendicular to the wind direction. An undesirable effect of this is that one turbine may be in the wake of another. As a result, the airflow received by the downstream turbine is typically more turbulent and its average speed is lower, reducing its efficiency. Turning the upstream turbine slightly (yaw angle) can attenuate this downstream effect. The efficiency of a turbine that is not perpendicular to the wind direction is naturally lower. This leads to an overall optimization problem where one has to dynamically control the different wind turbines taking into account the current wind direction.

## Renewable energy production (2)
Hydroelectric is another form of renewable energy. Water reservoirs are created by placing one or multiple dams on a river. These reservoirs drive a turbine which powers a generator. There are multiple challenges involved with hydroelectric power. The rainfall or water supply is seldom constant over the year. Placing multiple (not coordinated) dams on a river can have a large impact on the downstream ecosystems, power generation and flow. Proper management of the systems of dams on the network can lead to substantial increases in overall power generation.

## Renewable energy production (3)
Solar energy is becoming ever more visible in our environment. The optimal placement and configuration of a solar panel installation is not so trivial. Different effect play a role such as shading, panel orientation, solar angle evolution. Given a specific case, you could consider how to develop the optimal layout (accounting for seasonal variability).

## Optimal deployment of law enforcement forces
During large scale events (e.g. sport events, european summit, protest) additional law enforcement forces are deployed. Just as in a military context, the form of deployment of troops can have a major impact on the successful control of a mass of people. Possibly historical data can be used for this (cooperation police Antwerp).

## Pedestrian dynamics
Simple mathematical model for pedestrian dynamics can capture a number of features that are observed in actual pedestrian flows on walkways. For example, when obstacles get in their way, either physical obstacles or other pedestrians, walkers experience a repulsive social force, that alters their velocity and current direction to avoid collision. This alone is sufficient to produce a variety of patterns that are reminiscent of actual pedestrian dynamics. The explorable is a simplified variant of a series of beautiful models introduced by Dirk Helbing that have found a wide range of application, e.g. panic dynamics, crowd turbulence, traffic jams and more.

## Swarming (multiple projects)
The use of drone swarms has several applications in a military context. Drones can be equipped with different payloads such as high explosives, sensors (ISR), jammers, etc. Currently, all major military countries are conducting research on both the use of and the defense against drone swarms.

### Possible topics:
- **command and control (C2) of a drone swarm**: for the technology to be scalable, each element of the swarm should be cheap, so you will have a limited amount of control drones that are used for relaying communications with the HQ. The movement patterns of drones in different cases can be studied and optimised.
- **use of a drone swarm for ISR purposes**: drone swarms can be used to [gather intelligence](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-apparent-world-first-idf-deployed-drone-swarms-in-gaza-fighting/) in addition to more traditional assets. Given a specific scenario and an ISR capacity, determine optimal use cases.
- **defense against a drone swarm**: given an adversarial drone swarm attack, determine optimal techniques of defense (weapon system and/or engagement method).
- **attack using a drone swarm**:  given an adversial defense system, determine optimal techniques/patterns/tactics to maximise the impact of the attack.

## Mine hunting
Mine Counter Measure (MCM) is a general capability that can include several types of missions required to complete a specific operational intent:
- General or detailed survey to prepare Mine Warfare (MW) operations,
- Surveillance or exploration to assess Mine Warfare risk,
- Reconnaissance and Mine avoidance to avoid mine threat,
- Clearance to sanitize,
- Masking and jamming to prevent mine action,
- Provocation and discredit to deceive mine logic.

### Possible projects
- **optimise sweep patterns to maximise detection**: the detection probability of a mine depends on its position with respect to the sonar and the composition of the seabed. Simulate a minefield and try to optimise the sweeping settings to finetune the detection rate.
- **optimise mine field**: different types of (deep) sea mines exist. Given a set of mines, evaluate the composition/layout of a minefield for maximum effect.

## Airfield destruction
Destroying or rendering unusable an enemy airfield can have a major impact on the course of a conflict (think of the Six Day War). Typically, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles are used, each with a different effect and a different cost. A military airfield usually has a defense system against missiles and rockets where the interception rate is different for each weapon system. 
### Possible project
Consider an airport with its different components: the runway, the critical infrastructure (POL + control tower) and the different airplanes. You could look at Kleine Brogel or Florennes air base for inspiration. Determine the effect of using a specific set of weapon systems (ballistic & guided munitions, with submunitions or not with different CEP) and consider the optimal/ideal/minimal configuration that allows you to take out the airfield.

## Fine-tuning a grading system
Some universities allow a student to fail a course and still be able to go to the next year or be exempt from retaking the exam. A mishap in an otherwise good course can be forgiven as a result. The "optimal" ground rules of such a system are far from trivial. After all, there are conflicting interests to be realized. One wishes, on the one hand, to limit the number of students who can abuse the system and, on the other hand, to ensure that the majority of students can benefit from the system. In addition, for practical reasons, one may wish to limit the overall number of resits.

### Possible project
By using historical data over several years, it is possible to establish a multinomial distribution that describes the results of students in an academic bachelor. You can use this input to adjust the parameters of your system, taking into account a conflicting desired results (e.g. $<1\%$ “freeloaders”, limiting number of resits, maximal fair pardons).

However, the crypto market is much more volatile, so here it may be worthwhile to combine these optimisations with discrete event simulation and real data.
* **Insurance solvency**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or another suited method for a specific insurance to find an optimal balance between insurance premium and solvency.

## Logistics
Supply chain optimisation and the optimal use of personnel or resources can significantly increase the efficiency of a logistics depot. These problems can be solved with linear programming, but it is often difficult to reach a solution because these problems are typically NP-hard. As a solution, either heuristics (cf. next year) or discrete event simulation is used.

### Possible projects
- **Personnel tasking**: given a specific warehouse, increase efficiency by optimising the tasks each person is executing.
- **Warehouse layout**: given a set of products and historical order data, optimise warehouse or grocery store layout for highest possible output (e.g. something similar to collect and go from the perspective of the store personnel)
- **Seaport operations**: In a cargo port, there are a multitude of actors at work such as pilots, ships, cranes, trains, trucks, etc.  In the context of efficient use of resources, it is interesting to simulate this in order to identify possible bottlenecks in different scenarios.  If necessary, study a part of a Belgian port.
